## AI

- AI is software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities
- **Machine learning** is the foundation for an AI system and is the way we "teach" a computer model to make prediction and draw conclusions from data.
- **Anomaly detection** - a machine learning based technique that analyzes data over time and identifies unusual changes.
- **Computer Vision** -  Capabilities within AI to interpret the world visually. 
- **Natural language processing (NLP)** - interpret written or spoken language, and respond in kind.
- **Document intelligence** - managing, processing, and using high volumes of data found in forms and documents.
- **Knowledge mining** - extract information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store.
- **Generative AI** - creates original content in a variety of formats (NLP, image, code)

### **Machine Learning**

- is a technique that uses **mathematics** and **statistics** to create a model that can predict unknown values
-      Supervised Machine Learning
    - Regression 
        Function f that operates on feature x to calculate a predicted label y  
       ```f(x) = y```
    - Classification
        is a process of categorizing a given set of data into classes
-       Unsupervised Machine Learning
- #### ML in Azure
    - ***Automated machine learning***  enables non-experts to quickly create an effective ML model from data.
    - ***Azure Machine Learning designer*** no-code development of machine learning solutions.
    - ***Data metric visualization*** analyze and optimize your experiments with visualization.
    - ***Notebooks*** own code in managed Jupyter Notebook servers that are directly integrated in the studio.
