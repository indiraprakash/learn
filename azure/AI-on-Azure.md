### AI
- AI is the creation of software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities
- **Machine learning** is the foundation for an AI system and is the way we "teach" a computer model to make prediction and draw conclusions from data.
- **Anomaly detection** - a machine learning based technique that analyzes data over time and identifies unusual changes.
- **Computer Vision** - deals with visual processing (Seeing AI)
- Natural language processing (NLP) - oftware that understands written and spoken language

### **M**achine **L**earning

- is a technique that uses **mathematics** and **statistics** to create a model that can predict unknown values
-      Supervised Machine Learning
    - Regression 
        Function f that operates on feature x to calculate a predicted label y  
       ```f(x) = y```
    - Classification
        is a process of categorizing a given set of data into classes
-       Unsupervised Machine Learning
